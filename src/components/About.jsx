      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Weston Rwigema, a passionate Full Stack JavaScript Developer
        with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies. I
        recently graduated with a Full Stack JavaScript Development degree from
        Team Treehouse, where I honed my skills in React, Node.js, and
        Express.js.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a highly adaptable full stack JavaScript developer with a strong
        work ethic, always going above and beyond to meet expectations and
        goals. I have hands-on experience with React, Node.js, Express, and REST
        APIs, and have tackled real-world challenges like user authentication,
        API validation, and state management using React Context API. My passion
        for continuous learning, attention to detail, and commitment to growth
        ensure that I deliver quality results while continuously evolving as a
        software developer. Feel free to browse through my portfolio to see some
        of the projects I've worked on. If you'd like to collaborate or have any
        questions, don't hesitate to reach out!
